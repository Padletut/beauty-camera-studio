```bash
./script/build_ios.sh
```

**Output**

The compilation output is located in the `output` path under the root directory of the project.

## Mac
Execute the script file at the root directory of the project:

```bash
./script/build_macos.sh
```

**Output**

The compilation output is located in the `output` path under the root directory of the project.
