# Demo Program

This chapter will introduce the compilation and running methods of demos on various system platforms. The demo code is located in the `demo` directory:

::: tip
The source code is compiled using CMake. The latest compiled libraries for various platforms can be found [here](https://github.com/pixpark/gpupixel/releases/latest)
:::

## iOS
Make sure the iOS library has been compiled ([reference](build#ios)), open the project in `gpupixel/demo/ios` with Xcode

::: warning
If you are creating your own Xcode project, remember to turn off the `Build Settings -> Compress PNG Files -> NO` option, otherwise it will cause image color inversion
:::

## Mac
Make sure the MacOS library has been compiled ([reference](build#mac)), open the project in `gpupixel/demo/mac` with Xcode

::: warning
If you are creating your own Xcode project, remember to turn off the `Build Settings -> Compress PNG Files -> NO` option, otherwise it will cause image color inversion
:::

## Android

Copy the generated `gpupixel.aar` to the `demo/android/app/libs` directory, and open the directory `demo/android` with Android Studio

The calling logic is in `MainActivity`, select the app target, connect to the phone and run

## Desktop

Desktop Demo compilation requires the following environment:

### Environment Requirements
- Microsoft Visual Studio >= 2017 (Windows)
- cmake >= 3.10
- mesa-utils, libglu1-mesa-dev, freeglut3-dev, mesa-common-dev, libglfw3-dev (Linux)

**Windows Build Environment Configuration**

It is recommended to use Windows Terminal and select the corresponding VS environment tab for compilation.

If not using Windows Terminal, you can configure as follows:

- **64-bit compilation**: Find and click `vcvars64.bat` (x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017) in settings to open the VS virtual environment for compiling x64 architecture programs

::: warning
Windows only supports generating x86_64 Release version, x86_32 is not supported currently
:::

**Linux Build Environment Configuration**

```bash
./script/setup_env_linux.sh
```

### Compilation

After configuring the environment, execute the batch file at the root directory of the project:

**Windows:**

```bash
.\script\build_windows.bat
```

**Linux:**

```bash
./script/build_linux.sh
```

The demo is in the `output/bin` directory
